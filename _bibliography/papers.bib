  title={Drying kinetics, heat quantities, and physiochemical characteristics of strawberry puree by Refractance Window drying system},
  author={Srivastav, Shivmurti and Ganorkar, PM and Prajapati , Krupal.M and Patel , Devansh B.},
  abstract={Attempts were made to understand the drying kinetics, different heats involved, and change in physiochemical properties during Refractance Window (RW) drying of strawberry puree on an in-house fabricated RW drier. RW drying of puree was conducted at 75°C water temperature with 1.5 mm thickness. The drying was carried out from initial moisture content 614% (db) to 5.1% (db) with1.2 m/s exhaust air velocity. RW drying took place only in the falling rate period. The sensible heat of strawberry puree, convective heat loss from puree surface to air, and convective heat loss from the bottom surface (hot water to air) of the dryer were 70, 205, and 61.96 W, respectively. The evaporative capacity of 5.28 kg m−2 hr−1 was calculated at experimental parameters. This confirms that the drying system is advantageous. RW dried strawberry puree was rehydrated as exact of fresh strawberry puree considering total solids. Total phenolic content and ascorbic acid were significantly (p < .05) reduced from 246.33 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) (fresh strawberry puree) to 204.67 mg GAE per 100 g (reconstituted RW dried strawberry puree); 33.31–28.54 mg/100 g, respectively. Color characterization through L*, a*, b*, darkness factor (b*/a*), chroma (C), and hue angle (h*) revealed that reconstituted RW dried puree sample was darker compared with fresh puree.},

  title={Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) of bioactive compounds from fruit and vegetable processing by-products: A review},
  author={Srivastav, Shivmurti and Kumar, Kshitiz and Prajapati , Sharanagat and Vijay Singh},
  abstract={Growing fruit and vegetable processing industries generates a huge amount of by-products in the form of seed, skin, pomace, and rind containing a substantial quantity of bioactive compounds such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, carotenoids, and dietary fiber. These processing wastes are considered to be of negligible value compared to the processed fruit or vegetable due to lack of sustainable extraction technique. Conventional extraction has certain limitations in terms of time, energy, and solvent requirements. Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) can extract bioactive components in very less time, at low temperature, with lesser energy and solvent requirement. UAE as a non-thermal extraction technique is better equipped to retain the functionality of the bioactive compounds. However, the variables associated with UAE such as frequency, power, duty cycle, temperature, time, solvent type, liquid-solid ratio needs to be understood and optimized for each by-product. This article provides a review of mechanism, concept, factor affecting extraction of bioactive compounds with particular focus on fruit and vegetable by-products.},

  title={Changes in electrical conductivity of liquid foods during ohmic heating},
  author={Srivastav, Shivmurti and Roy, Srishti},
  abstract={Ohmic heating is a food processing method in which alternating current (AC) went through a food sample and resulted in internal energy generation in foods. It is an alternative fast heating technique. Its principal advantage is the ability to rapidly and uniformly heat food materials of various densities. During ohmic heating, change in electrical conductivity was observed. The intensity of food materials’ electrical conductivity or overall resistance critically controls ohmic heating rate. An ohmic heating set-up was prepared under this project. Tomato juice was heated (about 32℃ to 80℃) in a batch type ohmic heater at different voltage gradients in the range of 50–70 V/cm. It was statistically found that the voltage gradient had significant impact on conductivity and system performance coefficient (SPC) (P less than 0.05). It was concluded that the electrical conductivity values linearly increased with temperature. The SPCs of the system ranged between 0.779 and 0.943. The value of R2 of the linear model was greater than 0.98.},

  abstract={Drying characteristics, selection of analytical model and development of artificial neural network (ANN) models of 1 cm3 paneer at low pressure superheated steam drying (LPSSD) were studied. Effects of steam temperature and pressure on drying rates were determined. Page’s model was selected as the best predictive model. Second degree polynomial, non linear regression analysis resulted in a good agreement of defined model by changing the values of temperature and corresponding pressure. Optimized ANN models were developed for all data set. The correlation coefficient for all data set was >0.98 in all cases.},

  title={Development of Corrugated Fiber Board Cartons for Long Distance Transport of Tomatoes in India},
  author={Sharan, Girja and Srivastav, S and Rawale,Kishor P. and Dave, Umang},
  abstract={This paper contains an account of the development of corrugated fiber board (CFB) cartons for the transport of tomatoes for the growers of Gujarat, India and Himachal, India. Steps involved included (a) interaction with the growers in order to understand the problem associated with existing packaging (peti, a box made of strips of wood and the need for a substitute), (b) tests on peti under compression - drop and vibration testing to determine its strength and weakness for long truck journeys, (c) design of a new substitute, (boxes made of CFB) and testing of the prototypes in the laboratory and on actual road journeys, and (d) launch of the boxes in the market. The authors carried out the design, lab testing and field trials of the cartons in Gujarat and the launch of the cartons in the season of 2000. The developed cartons were implemented in Himachal with the launch taking place in the summer of 2001. Some undergraduate students of agricultural engineering were involved in the project as summer interns. Although technical papers based on this development were published elsewhere earlier, a comprehensive narrative detailing the context, the reasons for carrying out the work, and the steps involved was considered useful as it highlights the fact that some times important problems remain unsolved not because the engineering is difficult, but because the environment is such that the initiatives are lacking.},

  abstract={Paneer is highly perishable at ambient conditions and its shelf-life is very low. At high temperature, it develops a sour smell, and bitter taste. Drying can be one of the methods to increase shelf-life. Drying experiments were conducted at 62, 72 and 82°C and 10, 14 and 18 kPa absolute pressures with superheated steam. The product quality was judged by instrumental texture profile. Hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess and chewiness increased with increase in temperature and decreased with increase in pressure. Springiness and cohesiveness, however, decreased with increase in temperature and pressure. Textural properties of fresh and rehydrated paneer indicated large variation on hardness, adhesiveness and resilience whereas springiness, cohesiveness and chewiness had marginal variation as compared to fresh paneer.},

Milk treated by ohmic heating technology, Acidity (as lactic acid), Fat, SNF, Protein and Total solids were 0.063, 6.033, 5.840, 2.777 and 11.840 respectively which were very much comparable to those found in conventionally heating technology process.

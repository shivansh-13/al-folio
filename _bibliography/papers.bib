  abstract={Attempts were made to understand the drying kinetics, different heats involved, and change in physiochemical properties during Refractance Window (RW) drying of strawberry puree on an in-house fabricated RW drier. RW drying of puree was conducted at 75°C water temperature with 1.5 mm thickness. The drying was carried out from initial moisture content 614% (db) to 5.1% (db) with1.2 m/s exhaust air velocity. RW drying took place only in the falling rate period. The sensible heat of strawberry puree, convective heat loss from puree surface to air, and convective heat loss from the bottom surface (hot water to air) of the dryer were 70, 205, and 61.96 W, respectively. The evaporative capacity of 5.28 kg m−2 hr−1 was calculated at experimental parameters. This confirms that the drying system is advantageous. RW dried strawberry puree was rehydrated as exact of fresh strawberry puree considering total solids. Total phenolic content and ascorbic acid were significantly (p < .05) reduced from 246.33 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) (fresh strawberry puree) to 204.67 mg GAE per 100 g (reconstituted RW dried strawberry puree); 33.31–28.54 mg/100 g, respectively. Color characterization through L*, a*, b*, darkness factor (b*/a*), chroma (C), and hue angle (h*) revealed that reconstituted RW dried puree sample was darker compared with fresh puree.},

  author={Srivastav, Shivmurti and Kumar, Kshitiz and Prajapati , Sharanagat and Vijay Singh},
  abstract={Growing fruit and vegetable processing industries generates a huge amount of by-products in the form of seed, skin, pomace, and rind containing a substantial quantity of bioactive compounds such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, carotenoids, and dietary fiber. These processing wastes are considered to be of negligible value compared to the processed fruit or vegetable due to lack of sustainable extraction technique. Conventional extraction has certain limitations in terms of time, energy, and solvent requirements. Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) can extract bioactive components in very less time, at low temperature, with lesser energy and solvent requirement. UAE as a non-thermal extraction technique is better equipped to retain the functionality of the bioactive compounds. However, the variables associated with UAE such as frequency, power, duty cycle, temperature, time, solvent type, liquid-solid ratio needs to be understood and optimized for each by-product. This article provides a review of mechanism, concept, factor affecting extraction of bioactive compounds with particular focus on fruit and vegetable by-products.},

  title={Changes in electrical conductivity of liquid foods during ohmic heating},
  author={Srivastav, Shivmurti and Roy, Srishti},
  abstract={Ohmic heating is a food processing method in which alternating current (AC) went through a food sample and resulted in internal energy generation in foods. It is an alternative fast heating technique. Its principal advantage is the ability to rapidly and uniformly heat food materials of various densities. During ohmic heating, change in electrical conductivity was observed. The intensity of food materials’ electrical conductivity or overall resistance critically controls ohmic heating rate. An ohmic heating set-up was prepared under this project. Tomato juice was heated (about 32℃ to 80℃) in a batch type ohmic heater at different voltage gradients in the range of 50–70 V/cm. It was statistically found that the voltage gradient had significant impact on conductivity and system performance coefficient (SPC) (P less than 0.05). It was concluded that the electrical conductivity values linearly increased with temperature. The SPCs of the system ranged between 0.779 and 0.943. The value of R2 of the linear model was greater than 0.98.},

  abstract={This paper contains an account of the development of corrugated fiber board (CFB) cartons for the transport of tomatoes for the growers of Gujarat, India and Himachal, India. Steps involved included (a) interaction with the growers in order to understand the problem associated with existing packaging (peti, a box made of strips of wood and the need for a substitute), (b) tests on peti under compression - drop and vibration testing to determine its strength and weakness for long truck journeys, (c) design of a new substitute, (boxes made of CFB) and testing of the prototypes in the laboratory and on actual road journeys, and (d) launch of the boxes in the market. The authors carried out the design, lab testing and field trials of the cartons in Gujarat and the launch of the cartons in the season of 2000. The developed cartons were implemented in Himachal with the launch taking place in the summer of 2001. Some undergraduate students of agricultural engineering were involved in the project as summer interns. Although technical papers based on this development were published elsewhere earlier, a comprehensive narrative detailing the context, the reasons for carrying out the work, and the steps involved was considered useful as it highlights the fact that some times important problems remain unsolved not because the engineering is difficult, but because the environment is such that the initiatives are lacking.},

Drying can be one of the methods to increase shelf-life. Drying experiments were conducted at 62, 72 and 82°C and 10, 14 and 18 kPa absolute pressures with superheated steam. The product quality was judged by instrumental texture profile. Hardness, adhesiveness, gumminess and chewiness increased with increase in temperature and decreased with increase in pressure. Springiness and cohesiveness, however, decreased with increase in temperature and pressure. Textural properties of fresh and rehydrated paneer indicated large variation on hardness, adhesiveness and resilience whereas springiness, cohesiveness and chewiness had marginal variation as compared to fresh paneer.},

  author={Srivastav,Shivmurti},
  abstract={Thermal conductivity is one of the important thermal properties of food materials. It is essential during the calculation of heat transfer process through conduction. The setup was constructed by installing a single operational amplifier LM741, precision centigrade temperature sensors LM35, series 3-terminal negative regulators LM7915C, series voltage regulators LM7815C and LM7805C. LM741. The input to the setup was AC mains supplies 220V, 50 Hz which is transformed to 24V by step-down transformer. LM35 were used as a temperature sensor which gives output of 10mV/oC. To convert mV into V inverting amplifier LM741 has been used. The required voltage values can be read from digital multi-meter by connecting the positive and negative terminal. After successful development, calibration and testing of the setup, it has been utilized to calculate the thermal conductivity of wheat, sorghum and rice. The initial moisture content of all three different grains was found 7.88, 10.33 and 14 per cent wet basis, respectively. Thermal conductivity of wheat, sorghum and rice was found in the range of 0.199-0.115W/mK, 0.202-0.139 W/m K and 0.53-0.48 W/m K, respectively at the temperature range from 40 to 600C. The performance of the optimal neural network with 15 hidden layers and 20 neurons in each hiiden layer was done by using a different data set.

Energy consumption and quality of dried products are critical parameters in the selection of drying process. An optimum drying system for the preparation of quality dehydrated products is cost effective as it shortens the drying time and cause minimum damage to the product. To reduce the energy utilization and operational cost new dimensions came up in drying techniques (Sagar.V et al. 2010). New drying techniques are emerging that provide certain significant advantages in terms of one or more of the following: energy consumption, product quality, safety, environmental impact, cost of dehydration, and productivity (Mujumdar, A.S. 2001).},

In this process heating rate depends upon the electrical conductivity and field strength. By this method a product undergoes a minimum structural damage, retain its nutritional value. This technique gives excellent processed quality products in minimum operating time. Electrical conductivity of food products is linear with different temperature range. Energy during ohmic heating is dissipated directly into the foods. Ohmic heating can be utilized in different preprocessing and processing operations like blanching, evaporation, dehydration, fermentation, extraction, sterilization, pasteurization etc. Additionally research revealed that there is no protein denaturation at high temperature when heated with ohmic heating, also in the presence of starch, unusual conductivity behaviors found due to starch gelatinization.},

  title={Temperature distribution analysis in tomato carton by finite difference approximation method.},
  author={Srivastav, Shivmurti and G., Sharan},
  abstract={In this write-up, we present an analysis of temperature distribution in tomato carton using finite difference approximation. When freshly harvested tomatoes are placed in a rectangular heap, in a surrounding of 35 degree centigrade temperature, the temperature in the center of the heap is about 2.5 degree centigrade higher than outside. The size of heap considered is equal to that typically contained in a 20 kg carton. When the heap is contained in a carton of cardboard, the difference rises to 4 degree centigrade, and 5 degree centigrade, in case of wood. Eight holes, of 20 mm diameter each, are needed to ventilate the carton adequately.},
